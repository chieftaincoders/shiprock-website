            The Shiprock High school cheer leaders cheer for basketball and football games, each sport having its own specific cheer,
            with some cheers that are used throughout both seasons. Cheer leaders of 2015-2016 were mostly seniors and have graduated,
            the cheer leaders for 2016-2017 will need some new members, and encourage students to join.
