            <p class="bandp3 bandp2">
                "It's a very fun and exciting experience to be in the Shiprock High School band. The butterflies you get in
                your stomach before performing at the NAU Marching Festival or a football halftime show. We don't call it
                football season, for us, it's marching band season. Its such a life-changing experience. I've seen students,
                who were insercure and scared of making new friends, blossom and make not only friends in the band, but family.
                Our band is a big family and we love doing what we do. We take long trips, 6 hours to 10 hour drives and it's
                worth it. Freshman get to know Seniors and make friends. We love the band and it's a very different experience
                and it can change your life."
