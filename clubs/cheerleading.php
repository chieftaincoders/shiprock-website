                The Shiprock High school cheer leaders cheer for both home basketball and football games, each sport having its own specific cheer,
                with some cheers that are used throughout both seasons. Cheer leaders of 2015-2016 were mostly seniors and have graduated,
                the cheer leaders for 2016-2017 will need more new members so students are encouraged to join.
