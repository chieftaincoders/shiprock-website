                FFA is a club that pushes you to learn about the environment, and agricultural uses. FFA Members compete against school around the
                district and out of State. The competitions are based around agriculture questions and scenarios, mixed with math
                questions, and general questions about the subject. Members travel for the competitions or conventions, where they get the chance
                to meet other FFA members. FFA is creating a better community for all of the inhabitants, and teaches about agricultural
                uses.

                "It was awesome to learn new things, see new sites, travel to new places, make new friends, and have fun at the
                same time. It's a lot of work, you can't do it alone, you need friends and members to help you. If there are any opportunities,
                take them, its all part of the fun."
