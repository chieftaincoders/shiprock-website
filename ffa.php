            FFA pushes you to learn about the enviroment, and agricultural uses. FFA Members compete against school around the
            district, and some out of State. The competitions are based around agriculture questions and scenarios, mixed with math
            questions, and questions about the subject. Members travel for the competitions or conventions, where they get the chance
            to meet other FFA members. FFA is creating a better community for all of the inhabitants, and teaches about agricultural
            uses.
